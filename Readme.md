# File Processing


Problem solved:- I have a large dropbox with many many duplicate files, so want to find those duplicate files (if their byte content or hash is exactly the same) based on their content.

Solutions:-

* Linear file processing:- Takes a lot of time imagine if file size is in GBs or even TBs.
